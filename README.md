# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-R-Package-Comparison
The project focussed on four selected EDA packages i.e. funModeling, SmartEDA,  DataExplorer and visdat. The selected EDA packages are applied on different datasets in  different ways in order to compare their strengths and weaknesses.

The model used three case studies i.e. Human Activity Recognition, Covid-19 Vaccination Progress and Bankruptcy Prediction in order to perform EDA Analysis and do comparison of different packages
